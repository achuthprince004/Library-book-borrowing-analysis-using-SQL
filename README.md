# 📚 Library Book Borrowing Analysis using SQL

This project involves data exploration using SQL to uncover patterns and insights from a library transaction dataset. It focuses on understanding user behavior (students vs faculty), popular genres, borrowing trends, and reading durations.

---

## 📂 Dataset Source

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Library Transaction Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/library-transaction-dataset)

It includes transactional records from a library system, allowing for deep behavioral and trend analysis using SQL.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset (`mytable`) includes the following key fields:

- `user_id`: Unique ID of the borrower
- `user_role`: Role of the user (e.g., Student or Faculty)
- `book_category`: Genre/category of the borrowed book
- `borrow_date`: Date when the book was borrowed
- `return_date`: Date when the book was returned
